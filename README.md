# CSE22x1 Exercises
These projects were done with OSU's **[CSE Components Library](https://cse22x1.engineering.osu.edu/common/doc/)**. The components provide the backbone for the projects; they are needed to be downloaded and included in the project library build path. The original `components.jar` file is provided in the `/CSE22x1` folder.
