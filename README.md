# CSE22x1 Exercises

These projects were done with OSU's **[CSE Components Library](https://cse22x1.engineering.osu.edu/common/doc/)**. The components provide the backbone for the projects; they are needed to be downloaded and included in the project library build path. The original `components.jar` file is provided in the home directory.

## Projects Overview

#### Array Sift Down  
A program to test the `siftDown` operation on an integer array. It verifies if a subtree of an array satisfies the heap property and includes heap-related operations.  

#### Binary Tree Methods  
Implements static methods for `BinaryTree`, including height calculation and checking if a value exists in the tree.

#### BL Parser  
A parser for BL (a simple programming language). It reads a BL program and constructs a structured representation of its components. Includes methods for parsing instructions and statements. Credit: Daniel B. and Shapiy S.  

#### Boolean Expression Evaluator  
Evaluates Boolean expressions using NOT, AND, and OR operators with operands T and F. It tokenizes expressions and computes their results.  

#### Glossary  
Processes an input file of words and definitions to generate an HTML-based glossary, linking related terms dynamically.  

#### List with Two Smart Nodes  
Implements a linked list with two "smart" nodes to optimize operations, ensuring efficient performance for list modifications.  

#### Map on Queue  
A map implementation using a queue to store key-value pairs.  

#### Map with Hashing  
A hash table implementation using a map for each bucket. Supports efficient key-value storage and retrieval. Credit: Daniel Belyea & Shapiy Sagiev.  

#### Natural Number on String  
Represents a natural number as a string and implements arithmetic operations.  

#### Program Pretty Print  
Formats and pretty-prints a structured program representation for better readability.  

#### Queue Insertion Sort  
Implements insertion sort using a queue data structure. **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Queue Quick Sort  
Implements quicksort using a queue data structure. **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Sequence On Stack  
Implements a sequence using a stack, leveraging LIFO operations. **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Sequence Palindrome  
Checks whether a given sequence forms a palindrome.  

#### Sequence Smooth  
Smooths a sequence by averaging adjacent elements to create a smoother transition between values.  

#### Set on BST  
Implements a set data structure using a binary search tree (BST). **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Set on Queue  
Implements a set using a queue as the underlying data structure. **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Sorting Machine with Heapsort  
Implements a sorting machine that sorts elements using heapsort. **This project is incomplete and contains TODO comments that need to be addressed.**  

#### Stack with Linked List  
Implements a stack using a linked list to manage elements.  

#### Tag Cloud Generator  
Generates a tag cloud from an input text file, displaying word frequencies visually.  

#### Tag Cloud (Java)  
A Java-based implementation of a tag cloud generator, similar to the previous project but possibly with different processing techniques.  

#### Word Counter  
Counts word occurrences in a given text file and outputs the frequencies.

### Additional Notes:
- **Any project with `TODO` comments or incomplete methods needs further implementation.**
